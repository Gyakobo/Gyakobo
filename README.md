# Hi there! üëã I'm Andrew Gyakobo
üî≠ Research Assistant & Java Developer @ NJIT
 
Designing and developing cutting-edge Java applications at the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), I focus on creating seamless user experiences and ensuring compatibility with cloud databases. As I pursue my Bachelor of Applied Science in Computer Science, I dive deep into software engineering, web development, and artificial intelligence. My toolkit includes Git, MongoDB, GitHub, C#, and, of course, Java.

My work experience is complemented by an impressive win at HackNJIT 2021, where I secured first place with a physics engine simulating fluid mechanics and object viscosity in C++, using OpenGL and GFLW3 libraries.
