# Hi there! 👋 I'm Andrew Gyakobo
🔭 Research Assistant & Java Developer @ NJIT
 
Designing and developing cutting-edge Java applications at the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), I focus on creating seamless user experiences and ensuring compatibility with cloud databases. As I pursue my Bachelor of Applied Science in Computer Science, I dive deep into software engineering, web development, and artificial intelligence. My toolkit includes Git, MongoDB, GitHub, C#, and, of course, Java.

🚀 Software Engineering Intern @ Solera, Inc.
 
During my recent internship at Solera, Inc., I honed my skills by developing robust C#/.Net code and building dynamic HTML websites for clients. My work experience is complemented by an impressive win at HackNJIT 2021, where I secured first place with a physics engine simulating fluid mechanics and object viscosity in C++, using OpenGL and GFLW3 libraries.

🏆 Passionate Innovator & Developer

I thrive on creating innovative solutions that make a difference in people's lives. My passion for learning and collaboration drives me to engage with diverse and talented teams, always aiming to contribute meaningfully to the vision and mission of any organization I join.

Let's build something amazing together! 🌟
